# S-SNAP1.1
The program corresponds to the paper named "Tracking Earthquake Sequences in Real Time: Application of Seismicity-Scanning based on Navigated Automatic Phase-Picking (S-SNAP) to the 2019 Ridgecrest, California Sequence" by Tan et al. 2020. Geophysical Journal International. Please cite the paper if you use the code. Also, consider cite the original S-SNAP paper (see S-SNAP1.0). 

# Run the test
Run "0S-SNAP.py" with python3 and some packages (see imports at the beginning). The results will show up in the folder "07". Explore parameters as you want once you obtain the correct results. To make sure your results are identical with the S-SNAP catalog in the paper, you may download the catalog from the paper suplimental materials.
